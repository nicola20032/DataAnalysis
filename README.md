# DataAnalysis
Lab1 is a exploratory analysis on a world happines dataset
Lab2 is a correlation analysis on the same dataset
Lab3 is a regression analysis which explains dependancy of Inflation rate and Effective Federal Funds Rate
Lab4 is a try to make an ANOVA on credit score data set. So, I`ve concideted an Income to be a random variable, and Education Degree to be a treatment factor. But this dataset does not meet prerequisites.
